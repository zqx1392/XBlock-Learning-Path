# XBlock-Learning-Path

This folder is consisted of 4 important base files

1. myxblock.py - used as server, it will save all user data and send users Front-End files (html,css,js). It will send variables directly to myxblock.html and transfer action and data via myxblock.js


2. myxblock.html - added base question interface

3. myxblock.css - added base question css 


4. myxblock.js - only add animation for choices, will add interaction with server later.
